# What is the difference between a commit and a push?

Commit: this is a process that allows the user to save locally (save before a commit).

Push: this is a process that allows the user to publish the commit to the online/global GitHub.

# What is the difference between a push and a pull

Push: this is a process that will update the online GitHub/remote global from the updated local user commits.

Pull: this is a process that downloads all new updates from the online repo remote/GitHub. Once it is downloaded, it attempts to merge local files with global files that were downloaded.


# When do you need to pull?

Pull is needed at the begining of a repo. Start of day, when a team member tells the team to pull/a new update(s) werer added, or local project has issues and you need a new/clean copy. Another example for a pull can be used for a branch, fork, clone, etc.
